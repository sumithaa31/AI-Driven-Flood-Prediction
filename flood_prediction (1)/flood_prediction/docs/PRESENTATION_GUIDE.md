```

**Open:** http://localhost:5000 (prepare in background before presentation)

#### Step 2: Interactive Predictions

**Demo Script:**

1. **Click Mumbai:**
   > "Let me click on Mumbai, a coastal city. The system extracts satellite data from Google Earth Engine..."
   
   **Expected Result:**
   - Flood Probability: ~97-98% (HIGH)
   - Elevation: ~15 meters (low)
   - Slope: ~3 degrees (flat)
   
   > "Mumbai shows HIGH risk because it's a low-lying coastal area with minimal slope."

2. **Click Bangalore:**
   > "Now let's try Bangalore, which is inland and elevated..."
   
   **Expected Result:**
   - Flood Probability: ~3-5% (LOW)
   - Elevation: ~900 meters (high)
   - Slope: ~3 degrees
   
   > "Bangalore shows LOW risk due to its high elevation—nearly 900 meters above sea level."

3. **Quick Buttons Demo:**
   > "I've added quick buttons for major cities. Watch how fast it processes..."
   
   **Click:** Delhi → Chennai → Hyderabad (rapid succession)
   
   > "Notice the pattern: coastal low-elevation cities are HIGH risk, inland elevated cities are LOW risk."

**Point out key datasets:**
```python
# 1. CHIRPS Rainfall Dataset
'UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY'

# 2. ERA5-Land Soil Moisture
'ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/DAILY_AGGR'

# 3. SRTM Elevation
'USGS/SRTMGL1_003'

# 4. Slope (derived from elevation)
ee.Terrain.slope(elevation)
```

**Show:** `models/random_forest_flood_model.pkl` (523 KB)

**Say:**
> "The trained Random Forest model is only 523 KB but achieves 95.6% accuracy on test data."

---

### Part 4: ArcGIS Integration (4 min)

#### Step 1: Generate Predictions
```bash
python src/generate_arcgis_predictions.py
```

**While running:**
> "I can generate predictions for multiple locations at once and export to ArcGIS-compatible formats..."

**Show progress bar:**
- 10 major Indian cities being processed
- Real-time GEE data extraction
- Model predictions

#### Step 2: Show Generated Files

**Navigate to:** `data/outputs/arcgis/`

**List files:**
```
✅ flood_risk_india_major_cities.geojson
✅ flood_risk_india_major_cities.shp
✅ flood_risk_india_major_cities.csv
✅ flood_risk_india_major_cities_layer.json
```

**Say:**
> "The system exports in four formats: GeoJSON for ArcGIS Online, Shapefile for ArcGIS Pro, CSV for quick import, and a layer definition for automatic symbology."

#### Step 3: Open CSV in Excel (or show content)

**Show table:**
| Location | Latitude | Longitude | Flood Prob | Risk Level | Elevation | Slope |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Mumbai | 19.076 | 72.878 | 0.977 | HIGH | 14.74 | 3.15 |
| Chennai | 13.083 | 80.271 | 0.968 | HIGH | 6.40 | 1.56 |
| Delhi | 28.704 | 77.103 | 0.035 | LOW | 216.03 | 3.28 |
| Bangalore | 12.972 | 77.595 | 0.041 | LOW | 897.37 | 3.26 |

**Highlight:**
> "See the pattern? High elevation = Low risk. Mumbai at 15m → 98% risk. Bangalore at 900m → 4% risk."

#### Step 4: (Optional) Import to ArcGIS Online

If you have time and internet:
1. Go to arcgis.com
2. Upload `flood_risk_india_major_cities.geojson`
3. Show map with color-coded risk levels
4. Zoom to show spatial patterns

**Say:**
> "In ArcGIS, we can create professional flood risk maps with proper symbology—green for LOW, yellow for MEDIUM, red for HIGH risk."

### Part 5: Model Performance (2 min)

**Show:** Training report or create a PowerPoint slide

**Key Metrics:**
```
✅ Test Accuracy: 95.6%
✅ ROC-AUC Score: 0.998
✅ Precision: 96.0%
✅ Recall: 96.0%
✅ F1-Score: 96.0%
```

**Feature Importance:**
```
1. Slope:         45.78% ⛰️
2. Elevation:     45.22% 📏
3. Soil Moisture:  6.19% 💧
4. Rainfall:       2.81% 🌧️
```

**Say:**
> "The model achieves 95.6% accuracy. Interestingly, topography—slope and elevation—accounts for 90% of the prediction power. This makes sense: water flows downhill and accumulates in low-lying areas."

**Show confusion matrix** (if you have a visual):
```
Predicted:     NO  |  YES
Actual NO:    121 |   4
Actual YES:     7 | 118
```

**Say:**
> "Out of 250 test samples, we only misclassified 11 cases—that's excellent for a flood prediction model."

## 🗣️ Common Q&A

### Q1: "How is this different from weather forecasts?"
**A:** "Weather forecasts predict future rainfall. My system assesses flood *susceptibility* based on current/recent environmental conditions—rainfall, soil saturation, and topography. It's complementary to weather forecasts."

### Q2: "Can this predict the exact time a flood will occur?"
**A:** "No, this is a *risk assessment* system, not a real-time warning system. It identifies locations with high flood susceptibility based on historical patterns. For exact timing, you'd need real-time monitoring and hydrological modeling."

### Q3: "Why only 4 features? Why not use more data?"
**A:** "Simplicity and efficiency. With just 4 features, we achieve 95.6% accuracy. More features could lead to overfitting and require more computational resources. Topography alone (slope + elevation) accounts for 90% of the prediction—that's the key insight."

### Q4: "How did you validate the model?"
**A:** "I used an 80/20 train-test split with 1250 samples. The model was trained on 1000 samples and tested on 250 unseen samples, achieving 95.6% accuracy. I also used cross-validation during training to prevent overfitting."

### Q5: "Can this be used in real disasters?"
**A:** "As an academic project, it demonstrates the approach. For real deployment, you'd need: (1) real-time data pipelines, (2) validation against actual flood events, (3) integration with disaster management systems, and (4) consideration of local drainage infrastructure."

### Q6: "What's the ArcGIS integration used for?"
**A:** "ArcGIS is the professional standard for spatial analysis. My system exports predictions as GeoJSON and Shapefiles, which can be imported into ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro to create professional flood risk maps for government agencies or NGOs."

### Q7: "How long does a prediction take?"
**A:** "About 3-5 seconds per location. Most of the time is spent querying Google Earth Engine for satellite data. The ML prediction itself is instant (milliseconds)."

### Q8: "Can you predict for locations outside India?"
**A:** "Technically yes—the satellite datasets are global. However, the model was trained on Indian locations, so predictions for other countries may not be as accurate. You'd need to retrain with data from those regions."
